# Guide
This is a guide into other repositories and resources. Most of the code was created to explore ideas and was not prepared as a final product ready for publication. As time allows I turn selected pieces of code into publication form - jupyter notebooks, markdown files or html/pdf.

## Kaggle competitions

* Lending Club Dataset - predicting loan default
  * (soon) Notebook investigating the default of loans - exploration and predictive models
  * (soon) Notebook containing an XGBoost predictive model
* Leaf Classification Competition
  * [Notebook showing scikit-learn tools application](https://github.com/ibah/kaggle-leaf-classification/blob/master/mLeaf3.ipynb)
  * [Repo with Python](https://github.com/ibah/kaggle-leaf-classification)
* Titanic Competition
  * [Repo with R](https://github.com/ibah/kaggle-Titanic--Python-) - mostly exploration of data, but also a model
  * [Repo in Python](https://github.com/ibah/kaggle-Titanic--Python-)

## Python 

* Python packages study
  * [Repo](https://github.com/ibah/python-study) - contains solutions to exercises in numpy, pandas and a course in computational statistics (using scipy)
* Python extracts (example code for future reference)
